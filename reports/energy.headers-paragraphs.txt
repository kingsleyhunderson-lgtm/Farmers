Notes:
- This file contains the key eyebrow (p.eyebrow), header (h1/h2/h3/h4) and body paragraph (<p>) entries found by searching `energy.html`.
- Many card headlines are repeated for each card item (h4). I summarized these under line 263 to avoid listing every card headline separately.
- If you want a fully exhaustive dump (every match verbatim), I can write that as well — say "exhaustive energy report" and I'll expand it.
